#+TITLE:Guile LMDB bindings

This allows to interact with LMDB in Guile. The focus of the library
is making an otherwise unforgiving LMDB C API more Scheme-ish and
lenient. Thus
- Values can be anything: strings, bytevectors, or wrapped ~val~
  objects.
- All the error codes are prettily displayed via Guile ~error~,
  preventing the further operations on error.
- Lots of optional arguments for (opinionated) non-mandatory
  arguments.

All the APIs are following the LMDB names, with ~mdb_~ prefix stripped
off, and with underscores replaced with hyphen. Thus ~mdb_env_create~
is ~env-create~. This might be problematic, because some of the names
(~val~) are really short and thus might collide with some
codebase. Thus, it's better to use this library with a prefix to avoid
nasty namespace errors.
